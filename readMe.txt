HW4 - Tomagatchi Pet: Soundcloud Rapper Edition

Raise a Soundcloud Rapper
Name - relevance bonus if name starts with "Lil''"
Age - starts at 13
increase Edginness - get a face tattoo, decreases music quality
increase Relevance - publicly insult a celebrity for clout, decreases music quality
increase Music Quality - autotune freestyle for one hour, decreases edginess and relevance

This is a basic Tomagatchi program, but instead of raising a pet, you will experience
the joy of managing a soundcloud rapper. The only truly different feature is that, just
like in real life, there is a relevance bonus if your rapper's name starts with "Lil'".
When prompted for action, the user will enter their answer as an integer 1-3.
